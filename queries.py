### Write Python code that uses the Django ORM to answer:

# How many total Characters are there?
from charactercreator.models import Character
len(Character.objects.all()) # 302

# How many of each specific subclass?


# How many total Items?


# How many of the Items are weapons? How many are not?


# On average, how many Items does each Character have?


# On average, how many Weapons does each character have?
