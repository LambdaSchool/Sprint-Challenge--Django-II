# To find out the total Characters, I used dir() and utilized the count() method - Character.objects.count(). 
# You would use the class name in place of Character. 
# When I used this I found that there were 302 characters


# Was having an issue with my computer so i was using my phone for the afternoon and now it's working well, so i will submit the other questions this evening or tomorrow. Just going to commit this for now.
